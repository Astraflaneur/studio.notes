# Studio Notes

A small notebook on the web.  
Essays, fragments, sketches & half-finished things I’m trying and sharing.  

**Live site** → [www.studionotes.com](https://astraflaneur.github.io/studio.notes/)

## About
This site is meant to feel less like a finished gallery and more like a studio —  
drafts, sketches, and fragments collected in public.  

- Built with plain **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS**  
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**  
- Lightweight, minimal, and distraction-free
